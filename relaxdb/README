= couch example wiki - relaxdb implementation =

(single_design_doc branch with patches to work with latest couchdb trunk (new _design/_view url schema))

* very basic associations (no assoc.create(attributes) for example)
* no way to load a single doc by id?!
* little support for custom views via RelaxDB::View (see word_count.rb)
* supports couchdb like view queries instead of hiding behind AR like API
* non-rails errors require extra handling for views
* no ad-hoc view creation makes testing a bit harder - new views are not created automatically but only after class reloading
