* generate real uuids when using couchdb < 0.9 (or just don't support < 0.9. probably the way to go)
* solve sorting (see sorting branch)
* #{name}= on has_many collections should do #{name}.clear
before adding items, to be consistent with ActiveRecord
("collection=objects: Replaces the collections content by deleting and
adding objects as appropriate.")
* view storage could be reduced by not emitting the doc, but using
 include_docs=true at query time
