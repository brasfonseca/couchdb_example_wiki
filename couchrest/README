(requires couchdb trunk, couchrest trunk as of 2009-03-15)

* creating page objects is easy via a page class that extends CouchRest::ExtendedDocuments
* versioning is easy: using a simple after_update hook that creates a copy of the old version on save
* word statistics are dead simple - a view with a map function that emits all the words and a reduce function to group them by word
* list of pages - load all page objects and show just title - could be improved by a special view that simply returns the titles

* improvements:
** automatic creation/updating of views like couchrest already does for its own views
